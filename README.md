# Overlook Hotel

## Introduction

The Overlook Hotel is an application where users can book hotel rooms. The user can book rooms by date, and by room type as long as there is availability. Customers can also view their upcoming and past stays. As a manager, users can see hotel information, add and delete bookings for a customer, and see any customers bookings.

## Ending Thoughts

At this point in my journey as a software developer, I am very proud of this application. Being able to navigate network requests for the first time was a very big win. Another win was being able to change the origonal webpack loader to handle SASS files. 

Possible Improvements: 

- Add an additional view or section to display past bookings and upcoming bookings, rather than displaying them in the same place. 
- Adding dynamic functionality for error handling as do dry up my code even further.
- Cleaning up the error handling css and styling to be more visually appealing.
